# Map of the Internet

## Background

Network routing researchers use graphs of the Internet constructed from 
real-world data in their research. These are large, complex graphs, the scale 
of which renders simple visualisation for easily conveying meaning to the 
viewer tricky at best. This project involves visualisation of Internet graphs 
to convey useful high-level information. The aim is to build tools which can 
generate visualisations similar to some of those hosted at CAIDA.

## Goals

1. Learn about the Internet, BGP, and inter-domain routing
2. Learn and understand one or more graph decomposition algorithms
3. Build application code to produce visualisations from real input data
